                We were founded on the belief that quality CBD should be
                effective and accessible to everyone. We keep our prices
                affordable by owning our process from beginning to endâ€”from our
                hemp farms in Central Oregon, to extraction, formulation, and
                packaging.

                Our Assistance Program is at the heart of who we are as a
                company. We are here for people who rely on the benefits of CBD,
                and extend up to 60% off Lazarus Naturals products to veterans,
                people on long-term disability, and those with limited means.
